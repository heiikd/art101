			<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>My partner and I used JSON to access a daily comic API.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My partner didn't have much issue, but my problems were easily fixable. I didn't wear my glasses while I worked and ended up missing a / in the url that didnt allow it to work, and I also hadn't turned on the json extension we downloaded in class. Once I fixed both of those, the API loaded successfully. </p>
