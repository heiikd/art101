			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab focused on personalizing our website with HTML, using different features like headings, paragraphs, and unordered lists. We are editing the website locally and then publishing it to the server, where it can be accessed by other people. It also focused on properly structuring our files.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't run into any problems, really. I forgot how to make a list properly and had to look in my notes, but that was an easy fix (I had forgotten to put li at the start of each line).  </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I think this lab went well!! I really enjoy checking my website and seeing everything I added actually show up the way it's supposed to. </p>
